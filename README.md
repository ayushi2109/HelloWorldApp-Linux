# This is a sample app to test AWS CodeDeploy.
 
 
 You can use this to test the deployments made by CodeDeploy to set up the environment. And when you are comfortable with deploying this sample app, it will be easy for you to Deploy your production app.

 Let me know in the issues if you want a specific part to test and want me to update the code accordingly.


 Thanks and Cheers.

     chmod +x ./install
     ./install auto
     service codedeploy-agent start

Please find more information on setting up your EC2 instance here:
     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/instances-ec2-create.html

The installation steps for CodeDeploy Agent are mentioned in the given doc :
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-linux.html


-----------------------------------
STEP 3: Create Application and Deployment Group in the CodeDeploy console.
-----------------------------------
 - You can create the application and deployment group using the CLI following this doc:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/tutorials-windows-upload-application.html

 - The steps 2, 3 and 4 in the above documentation instructs on how to create the deployment.

 - Using the console, create an Application and a deployment group and add the above prepared instance to that group.

 - Attach a service role which permits CodeDeploy to use the following roles:  AutoScalingFullAccess(If using Blue/green deployments), AmazonS3FullAccess,  AWSCodeDeployRole. Please feel free to change these policies as per needs.

-----------------------------------
STEP 5: Create Deployment
-----------------------------------

- Create the deployment in the above created deployment group but instead of S3, please use the Github Repository to test the deployment out.

[Please use the github repository only as a reference to expedite your work on your own discretion and do not use it in production unless tested properly]
